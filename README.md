## Background

## Tasks

### `movie-poster.zip`


Generate a movie poster for a real upcoming film. Your poster must:

 - be visually attractive,
 - reflect the [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_genre) of the film,
 - fulfill the specific `constraints` listed below (note: you don't need to 
   use the exact text of the constraint in your prompt), and 
 - attempt to include the title of the film as text in the generated image

Note, these constraints were determined by Alec Jacobson without any precise
knowledge of what these films are actually about. Any spoilers are purely
coincidental.

Include at least 10 drafts (including final image).
